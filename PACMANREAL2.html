        <p>Pac-Man,[14]<br> nickname "Pac", (voiced by Erin Mathews[15]) is the 15-year old title character of the series. He is described <br>by some as the last of the yellow Pac-People on Pac-World. Pac-Man's father Zac helped in the war against Commander Betrayus. Pac is a teenager[16] between 3'5"-4'0" tall[17] that just found out that it's his destiny to defeat the Ghosts and send Betrayus back to the Netherworld permanently. He feels lonely because he's the only Yellow One in Pac-World and he misses his parents very badly and is determined to find them no matter what, but sometimes gets too carried away when doing so since this would lead him to bigger problems or would usually leave him less time with his friends. He's guilt-ridden because he unleashed the ghost by accident. However, the president and his friends tell Pac to get over his guilt and protect Pac-World from evil. He can eat ghosts just like the legendary Yellow Ones did back in ancient times and also has a giant appetite that may sometimes lead to trouble since he can eat anything, even things that aren't food. With the power of the berries (which are similar to Power Pellets) from the Tree of Life, he gains helpful abilities like withstanding the Netherworld's environment with the Power Berry, being able to fly upon eating the Flying Berry, breathe ice with the Minty Ice Berry, breathe fire with the Minty Fiery Berry, become cybernetic with a drill and magnet upon eating the Titanium Berry, gain a chameleon-like body upon eating the Chameleon Berry, etc. Pac-Man is also the strongest and fastest Pac alive. With the help of his friends, Sir Cumference and the Ghost Gang (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde), he's ready for action. Pac vows to stop Betrayus and the ghosts. Pac-Man has had a temporary truce with Betrayus like when it came to the Ghosteroid, the Pointy Heads, and when the ghosts go missing.
Cylindria (voiced by<br> Andrea Libman[15]) is a 16-year old pink Pac-Girl with glasses who is over 3'5" tall, over 4'0" including hair.[17]<br> She is a teenager[16] who celebrates her birthday in the second season.[18] She is tomboyish and the brains of the team, often aiding her friends Pac and Spiral. She also has trouble trusting ghosts.[citation needed] Pinky, who has a crush on Pac, views her as a rival, thinking Cyli also has a crush on him, although she gets highly annoyed or shown to be jealous almost every time Pinky openly flirts with Pac,[19][20] another time Cyli said Pac was cute after eating a power berry that made him smart and changed his mannerisms[21] she even told Pac she loves him at the same time as Pinky,[22] hinting that she might have a crush on Pac. Pinky mocks her nickname, calling her "Silly" instead.[23]
Spiralton<br>[24] (voiced by Sam Vincent[15]) is a big red 16-year old teen[16] Pac-Boy over 4'5" tall (and over 5'0" including hair[17]) and<br> Pac's best friend and roommate who is nicknamed "Spiral". He and Pac share similar crazy personalities. Spiral loves to blow things up and he's interested in the history of Pac-World. He and Inky have the same observant-brainy trait, but Spiral isn't as serious. He refers to Pac as "Pacster".
The Ghost Gang <br>is a group of four ghosts from the original arcade game. Though they live in the Netherworld and are ruled by Lord Betrayus,<br> they pretend to be dumb and useless to Betrayus as they are actually good-natured spirits and secretly help Pac-Man in hopes that they can be redeemed enough to live again.
Blinky (voiced by Ian James Corlett[15]) is a red ghost, the second shortest and oldest of the Ghost Gang Siblings. He's the default leader<br> of the group, which differs greatly from his 1980s scaredy-cat counterpart. Also, he's crafty and can't always be trusted. He might act mean, but he deeply cares about his friends and his siblings; however, he might only be helping the Pacs because he likes to stay on the winning team. In the episode "The Pac Be with You", it is revealed that he's a Pac-Fu master[25] and has presumably fought against Master Goo alongside other Pac-Fu masters during the ghost wars. Pac dubs his World of Odd counterpart who resembles Cowardly Lion as Uncle Ghost.
Pinky <br>(voiced by Ashleigh Ball[15]) is a pink ghost, the only sister, the second youngest and smallest in the Ghost Gang Siblings. She is<br> described as sweet, girly and "a bad", but not a really bad guy"[26] She has a crush[27] on Pac-Man (like in Pac-Man World 2), and even got to kiss him.[28] She has a rivalry with Cylindria because they got off on the wrong foot, thinking Cyli might also have a crush on Pac-Man. Despite the gang's fear of Betrayus, Pinky is often the sole member of the gang who is willing to go out of her way to help Pac in the more risky situations. She is also the first to side with Pac even when the odds are more in Betrayus' favor. In the episode "Stand By Your Pac-Man", she revealed that she can transform into a pink cyclops ghost and she assumed this form in three other episodes in the second season. Pinky can be scatterbrained and naive at times. She often argues with her brothers, but loves them nonetheless. She has expressed a desire to get her original body back from the repository, but prioritizes Pac-Man's interests instead.[29] Pac dubs her World of Odd counterpart who resembles Dorothy Gale as Mama Ghost.
Inky (voiced by Lee Tockar[15]) is a blue ghost, the second oldest and second tallest in the Ghost Gang Siblings. He and Blinky are close <br>pals, though they fight sometimes. Although he is the smartest and most sarcastic of the four, he is easily distracted and lacks focus most of the time, with Blinky saying that Inky can "get lost in a thought". He has a habit of snorting when he laughs sometimes and can multiply.[30] Even though he helps the Ghost Gang undermine Betrayus' schemes, he has differed with Pinky on prioritizing Pac's interests over their own.[31] Pac dubs his World of Odd counterpart who resembles the Tin Woodman as Papa Ghost.
Clyde (voiced by<br> Brian Drummond[15]) is an orange ghost, the youngest and largest in the siblings. He's the most caring member of the group,<br> and although he often seems like a dim-witted ditz, he often comes up with pearls of great wisdom. Clyde has a soft side for soft and sweet things like Fuzbitz. Blinky gets annoyed with this. Clyde and Pac-Man also share the same characteristics when it comes to eating. Clyde is the peacekeeper of the Ghost Gang as well as the moral compass in helping Pac and his friends, although he is not above clanging heads together when necessary as Inky and Blinky have discovered. He can also speak nine languages, including monster and he can split into two halves just for fun or whenever he's unhappy. Pac dubs his World of Odd counterpart who resembles Scarecrow as Baby Ghost. As well as Blinky, he totally differs from his Hanna-Barbera series' counterpart, where he is the leader of the group and the cleverest member, being second only to the ghosts' evil leader Mezmeron. His middle name is Filbert.[32]
Betrayus,<br> full name Lord Betrayus Sneakerus Spheros,[33] (voiced by Sam Vincent[15]) is the Lord of the Ghosts and the Netherworld. He has<br> always been President Spheros' younger brother and the son of Rotunda. He really hates his older brother. Back when he was a commander, Betrayus once led a massive revolt against Pac-World in a plot to take over Pac-World (later named Pac-war 1). During this revolt and despite the fact that he had Ghosts serving him and the fact that he was well-armed, he was defeated. As punishment for his crimes, he was unusually stripped of his corporeal form (his body) and then he was banished to the Netherworld. Since then, he has been waiting and plotting for the day when he can gain steal the Tree of Life and obtain the Repository so that he can regain his corporal form. He is the most powerful fire ghost with his fiery claw hands. Unlike the other ghosts, he's white with red eyes. Betrayus makes all his Ghosts and Monsters of the Netherworld do all the hard work while he watches the action from his TV (the channels provided by "slug-cam"). He has vowed to defeat Pac while plotting to steal the Power Berries and has been shown to make a temporary truce with Pac-Man when it came to the threat of the Ghosteroid, the threat of the Pointy Heads, and whenever his ghosts go missing.
